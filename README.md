### About Baking Mice Unite
This is a fullstack application- a social media style online recipe book where the user can log in and post,read, edit and delete all their recipes as well as looking at other users recipes.

The app is structured in a way, that the user uploads their recipes to a category- so at a later stage, they can browse the recipes they have in, let's say, soups and stews.

### How It Is Done
Techs used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, MongoDB/Mongoose, Passport and Bootstrap.

The first step that has been taken was to set up the Database - MongoDB and using Mongoose for Schemas. Working on the backend was put under the guideline of MVC - Model, View, Controller and implementing Routes.
